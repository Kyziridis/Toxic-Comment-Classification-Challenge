# Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

#### Identify and classify toxic online comments.

As we all understand and experience, the occurrence of bad comments, which are often categorized as
”hate”, ”toxic”, ”insulting” or ”threat”, is an increasing problem on social media platforms and portals
like Yahoo!  Answers, Quora and Wikipedia.  At first, anyone would think that we should convince people
against posting this kind of stuff but then, since we cannot tell every single one of the internet users to
not post bad views/speech, it’s better if we can devise and implement a system that prevents users from
posting bad comments.
